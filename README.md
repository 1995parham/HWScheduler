# HWScheduler
## Introduction
An implementation of a hardware scheduler usually
can support only one scheduling algorithm. Consequently,
the hardware can support a narrow range of applications,
which work well under the same scheduling
algorithm. Unlike software components, a hardware unit
is less flexible and more difficult to modify after implementation.
As a result, hardware solutions are frequently
avoided. However, if the hardware scheduler is configurable
to support several scheduling algorithms, then the
hardware solutions become more flexible.
